# ETL-Job-Market-DA
[Full ETL process to find out what is needed in the Data Analyst Job Market in Vietnam]

As the Data Analyst job market becomes increasingly competitive, gaining deep insights into hiring demand is essential. To address this, I developed an automated system that provides insights into the Data Analyst job market in Vietnam.

The project consists of three main parts:

- **Extract**: Crawled job postings from TopCV using Python.

- **Transform**: Cleaned raw data and standardized key information fields.

- **Load**: Uploaded the processed data to Google Sheets via API, then built a minimalistic dashboard focusing on the most critical market indicators.
